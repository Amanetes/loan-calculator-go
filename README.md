This is the *Loan Calculator (Go)* project I made myself.


<p>Personal finances are an essential part of life. Sometimes, you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Letâ€™s develop a program that can help us with that!</p>
